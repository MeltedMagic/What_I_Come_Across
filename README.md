Repository for [What I Come Across](https://manu-samala.gitbook.io/what-ive-come-across/). Hopefully I maintain this till the end of time. Inspired by: [https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/gitbook](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/gitbook)

If there is anything I miss or anything that should be added, create a github issue and I will address as soon as I can.

I want this to be a set of notes and citations for everything interesting I come across and everything I want to remember forver. Hopefully this survives the multitude of computers, phones, and short-lived technology I will use over time and becomes something I can always come back to when in doubt or lost.

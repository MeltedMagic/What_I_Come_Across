# Save Everything

Time and time again have I seen webpages come and go, helpful pdfs appear only to return to the void sometime later, and that one funny youtube video get deleted or irreversibly modified for the worse. As such, I deemed it necessary to dedicate an entire section to archival. This will range from pressing `CMD+s` to installing applications and browser extensions and possibly backing things up to various cloud hosting services.

## Web Browser Extensions

* Web Archive
* Cache Extensions -- I'll need to look for them
* Instapaper/Pocket/etc.

## Software

* Youtube-DLP
  * Youtube videos are taken down or heavily modified on a regular basis. If you like a video in its current state, I suggest you download it with this. This also supports many sites.

## Cloud Hosting

## Hard Drives

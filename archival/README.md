# Archival (Save Everything)

Time and time again have I seen webpages come and go, helpful pdfs appear only to return to the void 
sometime later, and that one funny youtube video get deleted or irreversibly modified for the worse. As
such, I deemed it necessary to dedicate an entire section to archival. This will range from pressing
`CMD+s` to installing applications and browser extensions and possibly backing things up to various 
cloud hosting services.

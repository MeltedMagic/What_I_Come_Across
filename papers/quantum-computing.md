* A Quantum Engineer's Guide to Superconducting Qubits \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560)]
  * About: A good introductiion to superconducting qubits. I would encourage that you read the papers cited as well as this paper can only introduce so much in 60 or so pages.
* Circuit QED with Fluxonium Qubits: Theory of the Dispersive Regime \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1605](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1605)]
